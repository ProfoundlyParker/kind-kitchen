## Description
<p>A SvelteKit landing page for a vegan restaurant. Built with <strong>SvelteKit</strong>, <strong>SvelteKit routing</strong>, <strong>Vite</strong>, and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, deployed on <strong>Netlify</strong>.</p> Having recently joined <a href='https://www.shoplikeyougiveadamn.com/'>Shop Like You Give a Damn</a>'s team, I wanted to expand my knowledge with SvelteKit, as that is their main programming language. I also wanted to build a site honoring their vegan, fair, and sustainable slogan; something that I too would like to see more of in the world. Being a decade-long vegetarian, Kind Kitchen is the kind of restaurant I'd love to eat at! ðŸŒ±
